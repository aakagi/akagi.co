# Adventuring More

I recently took Ray Dalio's personality assessment, [PrinciplesYou](https://principlesyou.com/), and I seem to be an "Adventurer".

["Adventurers are motivated by taking part in fun, exciting, and adventurous activities and pursuits. They tend to be excitement-seeking, fun-loving, energetic, independent, open to new experiences, and spontaneous."](https://principlesyou.com/archetypes/adventurer)

This got me thinking a bit and threw me into a mini existential crisis. I feel like I'm not adventuring nearly as much as I'd like to!

For the past few months, my day-to-day has been roughly the same.

Wake up, code, eat, climb, eat, sleep.

Thankfully, most weekends in New York are an adventure, and that's probably a major reason why I love living here.

I'm obsessed with startups, which requires persistence and focus, but I'm wondering if there's a way I can maintain the necessary focus, while also making my life super adventurous.

Honestly, the answer is likely that life comes with tradeoffs...

That said, I'm sure there are things I can do to make life more adventurous, so I would love to hear from you!

How do you make your life more exciting and adventurous?

###### I should note that for me, building startups is one of the most exciting long-term adventures out there!
