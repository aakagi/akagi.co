###### Week 7

# A Scattered Mess

I was hoping to figure out some way to share my insights from the various things I learned and did this week.

Both my sources and my brain feel like a scattered mess right now, so instead of attempting to create order out of this mess, at least for this week, I'm going to go ahead and dump the mess right here.

Enjoy!
