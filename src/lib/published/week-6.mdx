###### Week 6

# The Man in the Arena

As I strugle to write this, I'm starting to understand why most weekly newsletters are compilations of aggregated insights.

When I first began writing these updates, I wanted to write about what I'm creating and how I'm creating it.

I quickly found myself struggling to write about what I'm working on because anything I'd end up writing about would either be a loose work-in-progress or something highly technical, both of which would be difficult to expain for different reasons.

For instance, for my "day-job" this past week, I've been focused on building a remote eye exam with websockets.

Writing about why I'm building what I'm building is difficult because there's a lot of context I'd have to provide, and there's also some strategic information I should omit, so I don't want to go through the trouble of navigating that.

The issue with writing about websockets is to do so appropriately for a non-technical audience would be very difficult. Also, if I'm being honest, I have zero desire to write about fucking websockets.

Aside from that, I could go into my ideation process for a couple of side projects I'm working on, but those thoughts are so scattered I don't think it would be very satisfying to read.

Entrepreneurial success stories may sound linear, but when you're in it, it's a total clusterfuck.

I'm not sure if I'll ever be "successful", but if I ever do "make it", I hope my journaling will remind me of how much of a clusterfuck this all was _ðŸ¥³_.

Anyway, we're 6 weeks into these weekly posts and now I'm wondering if there's a way I can make this both easier on myself and more intriguing for you all reading this.

One thing that comes to mind that I'd love to share with the world, is my love for learning from podcasts/audiobooks/youtube/etc.

I think it'll be fun for me to share the things I learn and the concepts I resonate with.

I'm happy with myself for sticking with this writing habit, and I look forward to keeping it up, but I think I'll enjoy the process more if I begin writing about the new things I've learned.

It's difficult to gauge how difficult something will be for oneself without doing it.

This week's writing reminds me of Teddy Roosevelt's famous "Man in the Arena" speech, so I'll end with that quote:

> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

###### I was about to title this week's post something along the lines of "why it's important to try shit out" but "The Man in the Arena" has a much more authoritative ring to it, and I wanted to share the quote, so I went with that instead.

###### This week's blog post was SO MUCH EASIER to write than most weeks because I'm not fucking hungover. NYC drinking is brutal, man.
