###### Week 6

# The Man in the Arena

As I strugle to write this, for the 6th week in a row, I'm starting to understand why most weekly newsletters are compilations of aggregated insights.

When I first began writing these updates, I wanted to write about what I'm creating and how I'm creating it.

I quickly found myself struggling to write about what I'm working on because anything I'd end up writing about would either be a loose work-in-progress or something highly technical, both of which would be difficult to expain for different reasons.

I could write about my day-job where I'm building a remote eye exam? This past week I focused on building out our new product which uses websockets.

I don't particularly want to write about what I'm working on for work, because there's probably some strategic information I'm supposed to omit, and I don't want to go through the trouble of navigating that.

Also, I don't particularly want to write about websockets because it's such a highly technical concept, I think it would take a lot of effort for me to do it well â€” and then I think very few of you would find the topic very interesting.

Aside from that, I could go into my ideation process for a couple of side projects I'm working on, but those thoughts are so scattered I don't think it would make a very satisfying thing to read.

Entrepreneurial success stories may sound linear, but when you're in it, it's a total clusterfuck.

Actually, I think that's part of why I want to write weekly updates though! I'm not sure if I'll be successful, but if I ever do "make it big" I hope this is able to document how much of a clusterfuck the process was _ðŸ¥³_.

Anyway, we're 6 weeks into these weekly posts and now I'm wondering if there's something I would find an easier time writing about, that you all would find more intriguing to read.

One thing I've been doing consistently for most of my adult life is to learn things via audiobooks/podcasts/youtube.

I think this weekly writing habit is good for me, but I think starting next week, I'd like to begin writing about things I learned, quotes I resonated with, or concepts I'm pondering, from the various sources I learned something from.

I'm happy with myself for sticking with this writing habit for 6 weeks, and I look forward to keeping it up, but I think I'll enjoy the process more if I begin writing about the new things I've learned.

It's difficult to gauge how difficult something will be for oneself without doing it.

This week's writing reminds me of Teddy Roosevelt's famous "Man in the Arena" speech, so I'll end with the quote:

> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

###### This week's blog post was SO MUCH EASIER to write than most weeks because I'm not fucking hungover. NYC drinking is brutal, man.

###### I was about to title this week's post something along the lines of "why it's important to try shit out" but "The Man in the Arena" has a much more authoritative ring to it, and I wanted to share the quote, so I went with that instead.
