# Attempting to Become Prolific

This is slightly embarrassing but I didn’t know the word "Prolific" until a couple years ago.

I learned it from my [brother](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1m__bDgRlraOPZ6acH_tJQ) when we were talking about Nipsey Hussle’s face tattoo when Nipsey passed away.

I love that word.

**Prolific**

Also I love that I was deeply inspired by a face tat.

Anyway, I haven’t published anything in years because I wasn’t quite sure what to write about. I felt like I had graduated from being a kid, but couldn’t figure out who I wanted to be as an adult.

There’s an infinite amount one can do in this world, and as as Paul Graham says, ["keep your identity small"](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html), and as Ray Dalio says ["Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can’t have everything you want"](https://twitter.com/raydalio/status/1355571809718915074) — so I kept asking myself the existential question: _what should I do_?

My roommate [Justin](https://www.instagram.com/justintmckibben/) and I have been cooking up ideas for the past few months, but as we finally jumped into building something today, it just didn’t feel right.

We talked about it, and he brought up that he didn’t really care _what_ we built, and that it didn’t have to be a smashing hit, and I liked that... less pressure.

I then went to the climbing gym to get my mind off things, and on the subway ride home, I figured it out! The goal isn’t to build something big. It’s to **create a culture of creating**. To be **✨Prolific✨**.

(Justin is already pretty damn prolific, so really it’s just me who has to get his shit together lmao.)

I’ve been wanting to develop a weekly writing habit a la [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), and I got started a handful of times, but I never published because it never quite felt right.

But this time it does feel right. I’d like to start publishing weekly updates about the things I create / produce / build each week with my friends.

Writing this is giving me ⚡️energy⚡️ and that feels good, so that’s what I’ll do!

Tbh I’m not sure where to publish yet, but I did [some fancy .mdx stuff](https://github.com/aakagi/akagi.co) for my personal site a month ago for this exact purpose, but also I’m a little nervous about custom-building a blog because it seems like unnecessary overhead.

Ehh whatever, fuck it ship it. 🚀

Please excuse my stream of consciousness writing. ✌️


###### I started writing this at around 10pm on Sunday July 11, 2021, and published it at around 11:30pm the same night.

###### This shit was hacked together and will hopefully improve as I keep doing it.

###### Ok, now I will go share this on my social medias.
