###### Week 8

# Consistency

Last week was a fairly intense week of work for me, and I then flew to LA to stop by to hang out with friends, before heading to the SF Bay Area to prep for this year's "Rogue Burn" aka "Renegade Man" aka "Unofficial Burning Man".

I am happy, excited, and grateful for this adventure, but I'm absolutely fucking exhausted right now.

I was laying in bed, thinking of skipping this week, but then I was like NAH I should write. My goal is to get the process right!

### Started a New Book

I started reading [Man's Search For Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning), written by a Holocaust survivor and psychologist, [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl), who shares his experience in concentration camps as a way to analyze what gives people meaning in life, even in the worst of circumstances.

> The salvation of man is through love and in love.

### Read an Incredible Blog Post

**Cancer patients get a torrent of conflicting advice thrown at them.**

Here's an incredible passage from the end:

> Coscarelli told me that, over the years, many wonderful and generous women had come to her clinic, and some of them had died very quickly. Yikes. I had to come clean: Not only was I un-wonderful. I was also kind of a bitch.
>
> God love her, she came through with exactly what I needed to hear: “I’ve seen some of the biggest bitches come in, and they’re still alive.”
>
> And that, my friends, was when I had my very first positive thought. I imagined all those bitches getting healthy, and I said to myself, I think I’m going to beat this thing.

###### oh wow apparently I consumed a lot of heavy/sad content this past week!

###### I'm liking this weekly review format because it's helping me look back and remember the things that stuck out to me.

###### I'm too tired to keep writing ok goodnight!
