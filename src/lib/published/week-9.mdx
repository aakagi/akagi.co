###### Week 9

# Burning Man

Our RV broke down ðŸ˜­ so we're stuck at a truck repair station in Sparks, Nevada.

I didn't think I would get a chance to write this week becuase I thought we'd be driving today, but now I have plenty of time on my hands so I figured I should write about Burning Man.

Most of you who know me well likely know that I am obsessed with this annual phenomenon, but whenever people ask me what I love about it, I find it difficult to explain what I love so much about it.

I didn't think I would get around to writing this week, but we ended up having to leave Black Rock City a day early to help a camp-member catch a flight, but then our RV broke down so now we're stranded in a truck stop for the night.

Thankfully we are in an RV so we have everything we need!

For me, Burning Man feels like a pagan holiday. Like, "it's time for the annual burn!"

I went to my 4th Burning Man this year!

It is literally my favorite thing in the world.
